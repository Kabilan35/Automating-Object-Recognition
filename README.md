FRONTEND
The frontend was built with Angular 4 and Typescript. A simple copy, paste of the src file into a created Angular 4 project will set it up. 
(I had already built the frontend and didn't realise i was using the wrong component name till later. Since, there is no Angular command to rename a component i'm stuck with this unless i redo it)

BACKEND
The Backend was build with Spring Boot using Java and Selenium
